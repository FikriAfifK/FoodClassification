# üçΩÔ∏è FoodClassification  
**Food Image Classification Project**

---

## üìå Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`Deteksi_Makanan_Model.ipynb`, `deteksi_makanan_v3.ipynb`) where I developed deep learning models for **classifying food images**.  
The goal is to train, evaluate, and refine models that can detect different types of food accurately.

## üìÇ Project Structure
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Deteksi_Makanan_Model.ipynb` | Initial exploration, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation |
| `deteksi_makanan_v3.ipynb`     | Version 3 with improved preprocessing, augmentation, or architecture |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Deep Learning: **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
To reproduce or extend the experiments:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FikriAfifK/FoodClassification.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FoodClassification

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

6. Open the notebook of your choice and run the cells step by step.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Export trained models as .h5 or TensorFlow SavedModel for integration in apps (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask).
- Build a web interface to upload images and get real-time predictions.
- Implement advanced augmentation or fine-tuning using pre-trained networks.
- Add support for new food categories or improve dataset diversity.
